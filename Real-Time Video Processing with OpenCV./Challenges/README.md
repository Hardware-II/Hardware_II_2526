Python + OpenCV Class Challenge
===============================

This file contains the class challenge for practicing Python and OpenCV. 
Students are expected to complete the tasks, experiment with the code, 
and submit their own solutions.

Challenge Goals
---------------
By completing this challenge, you will learn to:

- Install Python and OpenCV
- Access a webcam for real-time video streaming
- Apply basic image manipulations, including:
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Image resizing
  - Blur and filtering
  - Edge detection
  - Drawing shapes and text on frames

Setup Instructions
------------------
1. Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed.
2. Install required packages:

   pip install opencv-python numpy

3. Clone this repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

Tasks
-----
Complete the following tasks and submit your own version of the code:

1. Access your webcam and display live video.
2. Convert the video frames to grayscale.
3. Resize the video frames dynamically.
4. Apply a blur filter or edge detection to the frames.
5. Draw text or shapes (rectangle, circle, etc.) on the video.
6. Experiment with color space conversions (RGB ↔ HSV).
7. (Optional) Add any other creative image processing effect.

Tip: Make sure your code runs without errors and you can stop the webcam stream using a key (e.g., Q).

Submission Instructions
-----------------------
1. Save your completed script with your name, e.g., studentname_task.py
2. Upload it to the GitHub Classroom repository assigned to you.
3. Ensure your script runs correctly before submitting.

Deadline: Sunday 25th, 23:59
