Roboflow Dataset Collection Assignment
======================================

Objective:
----------
Prepare a high-quality dataset for object detection using Roboflow. 
This assignment focuses on collecting, annotating, and versioning a dataset for YOLO training.

Instructions:
-------------

1. Collect Real Images
----------------------
- Collect at least **200 real images** of your target objects.
- Ensure images are clear and representative of different scenarios.
- Include variations in angle, lighting, background, and size.

2. Full Annotation
------------------
- Annotate every object in each image using **bounding boxes**.
- Assign accurate labels to all objects.
- Carefully review annotations to avoid mistakes.

3. Create a Clean Dataset Version
---------------------------------
- Upload all images to Roboflow.
- Apply annotations and check for consistency.
- Apply **optional augmentations** to increase dataset variety.
- Save a **clean dataset version** in Roboflow.
- Export the dataset in **YOLO format** for model training.

Tips:
-----
- Organize images in folders before uploading if needed.
- Review your dataset multiple times for errors.
- Use versioning in Roboflow to track changes.

Deliverables:
-------------
- A fully annotated dataset with at least 200 images.
- A clean version in Roboflow, ready for YOLO export.
- Screenshots or a short report showing the dataset version and statistics.
